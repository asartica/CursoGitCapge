<p>where k &gt; 0 is the shape parameter and λ &gt; 0 is the scale
parameter of the distribution. Its complementary cumulative distribution
function is a stretched exponential function. The Weibull distribution
is related to a number of other probability distributions; in
particular, it interpolates between the exponential distribution (k = 1)
and the Rayleigh distribution (k = 2 and λ = 2 σ {={}} = ).</p>
<p>If thedSFSFSD quantity X is a “time-to-failure”, the Weibull
distribution gives a distribution for which the failure rate is
proportional to a power of time. The shape parameter, k, is that power
plus one, and so this parameter can be interpreted directly as
follows:[3]</p>
<pre><code>A value of k &lt; 1 {\displaystyle k&lt;1\,} {\displaystyle k&lt;1\,} indicates that the failure rate decreases over time (like in case of the Lindy effect, which however corresponds to Pareto distributions[4] rather than Weibull distributions). This happens if there is significant &quot;infant mortality&quot;, or defective items failing early and the failure rate decreasing over time as the defective items are weeded out of the population. In the context of the diffusion of innovations, this means negative word of mouth: the hazard function is a monotonically decreasing function of the proportion of adopters;
A value of k = 1 {\displaystyle k=1\,} {\displaystyle k=1\,} indicates that the failure rate is constant over time. This might suggest random external events are causing mortality, or failure. The Weibull distribution reduces to an exponential distribution;
A value of k &gt; 1 {\displaystyle k&gt;1\,} {\displaystyle k&gt;1\,} indicates that the failure rate increases with time. This happens if there is an &quot;aging</code></pre>
